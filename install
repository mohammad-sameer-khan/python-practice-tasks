1	Introduction

This manual describes the installation procedure for the Acquire Media Transmit
(AMX) product for UNIX and Linux systems.  It describes the preliminary steps
necessary before you install the software.  It also describes the basic
installation process. 

Important: Please read through this entire manual before beginning the
installation of the AMX software.

2	Overview of Acquire Media AMX Package

The AMX software consists of:
	AMX Interceiver. This is a daemon (named intcvr) that maintains a
connection between your system and the AMPS server at the Acquire Media
location in Newark, NJ.  This connection is used to transmit news and other
information to your system.
	WNDP Server. This daemon (named wndp) caches the data (news) files
created by the AMX Interceiver. It then provides a generic interface whereby
one or more external programs (usually other daemons) can receive and process
the news using the WNDP protocol
	One or more applications that process the XMLNews stories and
associated metadata files (RDF files)
 
3	Installation Overview

The AMX installation consists of a single tar archive containing all the
necessary components required for a full installation. 

The tar archive will have the following naming convention:

On UNIX:
amx#.#-solaris2.x-sparc.tar

where:

#.# - the release version of the software
2.x - the solaris operating system release level
sparc - processor type used

On Linux:
amx#.#-linux2.2.12-20.tar

where:

#.# - the release version of the software
2.2.12-20 - the Linux kernel version

Root access is required when running the installation program.  It is
recommended that all installations be performed from a directory other than
/tmp.  Information pertaining to both the new release being installed, as well
as the prior release (when applicable) will be kept in sub-directories beneath
the directory from which the installation is run.  If /tmp was used, and the
system was rebooted, all this information would be lost. 

3.1	Hardware Requirements

Hardware Platform:  Linux 32-bit/64-bit

Operating System:
CentOS/Redhad 5/6/7

Internet:  Machine should have a permanent connection to the Internet.
Note: AMPS uses port 443 (SSL - Secure Socket Layer). This port must be
open in your firewall.

DNS: DNS Name Resolution must be fully operational in order for the machine
to communicate back to the Acquire Media head-end.

IMPORTANT LINUX NOTE:
Make sure the slocate program is NOT configured to run.  It might be configured
via the /etc/cron.daily/slocate.cron.  This program is the Security Enhanced
version of the GNU Locate used to index new files as they are created into a
local database.  The large number of files created by AMX may cause serious
system degradation.  It is highly recommended that slocate NOT be run.

3.2	Installation components

The base level components of the tar archive are as follows:
AMX-UNIX-Linux-Install.doc - This document.
README - overview of installation package, licensing information, etc.
install - AMX installation utility.
amx#.#-solaris2.x-sparc.install.tar.bz2 - actual AMX archive in compressed form.
bunzip2 - decompression utility used on all *.bz2 archives.
CtrlFile - installation control file required by the install utility.
optional#.#-solaris2.x-sparc.install.tar.bz2 - optional software archive in compressed form.

Note: Under Linux, the .bz2 files will follow the naming convention outlined at the beginning of this section.

The archive is intended to be installed from the directory in which it was
unpacked.  Using a different directory will only work if all files have been
moved or copied.

3.3	Running the install script

The install script is used to perform the actual installation of software
components on your system.  This script requires root user permissions and
does the following:

Unpacks and creates a local installation tree for all software components in
the chosen product.
Sets correct permissions on all directories and files in the chosen release area.
Saves a record of the installation in /var/adm/amx/log/installation.log.
Please refer to the UNIX/Linux AdministratorÆs Guide for a detailed
description of the /var/adm/amx directory tree.
Displays information summarizing the products that have been installed.
Restores prior release (use if installation was unsuccessful).
Removes temporary installation files and the backup of the prior release
(use if installation was successful).

Usage: install [product [-rollback|-clean]|-info]

        -info          - Summarizes which products are installed
        -rollback      - Restores prior release
        -clean         - Removes temporary installation files and backup
                         of prior release

4	Pre-installation data table

The following information will be required before proceeding with the
installation.  Please fill in all required information in the last column of
the following table before starting:

DNS	required
----------------
DNS Name Resolution is required for the AMX Interceiver to communicate back to
the Acquire Media head-end.  If DNS is not operational, installation can still
take place.  If you choose to start the release after installation, the AMX
Interceiver will try forever to connect to the Acquire Media head-end until
DNS is operational.  No content will be received until DNS is restored.


UNIX/Linux user account	required
--------------------------------
For the initial installation, a valid administration account must be designated
under which all AMX processes will be run. Typically, an administration
account, such as nadmin, amxadmin etc. is used.  Do not attempt to give this
account root privileges (UID of 0) as this will render the AMX system
inoperable.  You may want to contact your system administrator.

Installation directory	required  (for initial installation only)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
A valid directory into which the software is to be installed. Please refer to
the Hardware Requirements outlined above for disk space requirements.  The
installation will fail if there is not sufficient space.


dedicated mail server	optional
--------------------------------
A local mail server can be specified for outgoing  email notification of the
status of the AMX Interceiver and the WNDP Server.


email account(s)	optional
--------------------------------
The AMX software can be configured to automatically generate an email message
under certain conditions.  There are typically three conditions that warrant
an automatic email notification:
1. daily status notification to monitor system health.
2. fatal condition encountered - one or more processes are down.
3. new software release has been dynamically received and should be
installed at the earliest possible convenience. Up to 10 email address can
be specified to receive each of these notification types.
    1. daily status
    2. fatal condition
    3. new software


AMX account info: 1. Username 2. Password 3. Account number	required
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The username, password and account number were given to you by customer
support or the Acquire Media website.


Proxy information 1. server 2. port number	optional
--------------------------------------------------------
If your site configuration is using a proxy server, you must enter this
information so that AMX can communicate back to the AMPS head end.


AmxViewer installation directory	optional
------------------------------------------------
AmxViewer is a utility for displaying real-time information as it is being
received. It is intended to be used as part of an administrator's console to
verify that news is flowing over the Internet from the Acquire Media AMPS
head-end to the server on which the AMX Interceiver is installed. This
application can be install remotely if desired.


5	Installing AMX

Some components of AMX (e.g., the Interceiver) are required and others
(e.g., the AMX File Archiver) are optional.  In either case three steps
should be performed to insure a successful installation:
Run the install script
Verify that installed program(s) run
Delete temporary and backup files

We now outline these three steps for each AMX component.
5.1	Required components

When installing the required components of AMX, a symbolic link called /nwsys
will be created to point to the user-chosen installation directory.  This
link must exist in order for AMX to function properly and should never be
deleted or modified.

The following procedure unpacks and installs the required components of AMX.
It is assumed that the AMX tar archive has already been downloaded to your
server and the installation is being run under the root (superuser) account.

Verify DNS Name Resolution is operational.  (It is important to note that
Acquire Media Corporation reserves the right to change the existing IP
address of this server in the future.)

# nslookup amps.acquiremedia.com
Server:  dns.server.com
Address:  x.x.x.x

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:    amps.acquiremedia.com
Address:  63.236.87.111

Note: Sometimes the above command is successful even when DNS is not fully
configured.  In such a case, it is usually the /etc/nsswitch.conf file which
is incorrect.

For Linux: /bin/ping amps.acquiremedia.com
Confirm you don't get the message: unknown host amps.acquiremedia.com.  It's
okay if the ping times out with no answer from amps.acquiremedia.com. If DNS
is not configured properly, the ping will immediately return with the unknown
host error.

Verify archive exists.

On Linux:
# ls amx*
amx1.7-linux2.2.12-20.tar

Verify architecture and OS version match that of the AMX tar archive via the
uname command.

On Linux:
# uname -r
2.2.12-20smp

(Note:  The trailing smp may or may not appear.)

Unpack the tar achive.  This can be done in any directory on the server.


Note: The AMX version number and corresponding block sizes of the files within
the archive do not necessarily match this document.

On Linux:

# tar xvf amx1.7-linux2.2.12-20.tar
./amx1.7-linux2.2.12-20.install.tar.bz2 
./bunzip2 
CtrlFile 
AMX-UNIX-Linux-Install.doc

scroller1.7-linux2.2.12-20.install.tar.bz2
website1.7-linux2.2.12-20.install.tar.bz2

Run the installation utility to unpack, decompress and install the software archive.  (Note:  In the following examples, the /pool directory was chosen for illustration purposes only.  There is no requirement that this directory exist in order to perform the installation. Also, if this is not the first AMX component being installed on the server, you will not be prompted for a valid user account to be the owner of the software about to be installed.)

# ./install amx

Cleaning amx
Installation files for AMX (release 1.7) have been removed.

5.2	Optional components
Optional software components do not have to be installed on the same server as AMX. When choosing to install optional software remotely, the install utility, CtrlFile and optional#.#àbz2 must be placed in the same directory on the remote server for proper installation.
5.2.1	Amx Viewer

Run the installation utility to unpack, decompress and install the Amx Viewer component archive.  Note: If News View is the first AMX component being installed on the server, you will be prompted for a valid user account to be the owner of the software about to be installed.

# ./install amxviewer
